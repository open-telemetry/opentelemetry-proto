# Contributing to OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) Specification

## Introduction

Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) Specification repository! ðŸŽ‰

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This repository contains the OTLP specification and the corresponding Language Independent Interface Types (`.proto` files). Your contributions help improve the interoperability of OpenTelemetry clients across various programming languages.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the community channels. We're happy to help! ðŸ˜Š

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Docker** â€“ [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* **Make** (for running development tasks)

Additional Notes:

* Windows users may need [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for better compatibility.

## Workflow

We follow a structured workflow to ensure smooth collaboration:

### Commit Message Format

* Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., `fix(proto): resolve issue with trace spec`)
* Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) where possible.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a new branch.
- Ensure `make all` pass locally before pushing.
- Link relevant issues in the PR description.

```

## Testing

To test your changes, run:

```bash
make test
```

To verify the protobuf definitions:

```bash
make proto-lint
```

## Troubleshooting

#### Protobuf Compiler Issues

**Error:** `protoc: command not found`

**Fix:** Install the protobuf compiler:
```bash
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler  # Linux
brew install protobuf  # macOS
```

#### Build Failures

**Error:** `Failed to generate gRPC client libraries`

**Fix:** Ensure Docker is running and retry:
```bash
make clean && make gen-all
```

#### Linting Errors

**Error:** `proto-lint: some files do not conform to style guidelines`

**Fix:** Run:
```bash
make proto-lint-fix
```
